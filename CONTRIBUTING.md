# How To Contribute

So, you’ve developed something interesting or fixed a defect and want to have it added to our official release? Lets learn about the contribution process so we can get your code baked into the next release.

## About Rights

The Bridge.NET project is [licensed](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/blob/master/LICENSE) as [Apache v2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). If you provide any code to us and your code is added to Bridge.NET, the code you provide will automatically inherit the same Apache License, Version 2.0.

Your contribution will be subject to license’s Clause #5.

> **5. Submission of Contributions.** Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account
2. **IMPORTANT:** Start a thread in the Bridge.NET [Community Forums](http://forums.bridge.net) related to your issue
 - Start the conversation regarding this defect or feature
 - Please provide a simplified code sample demonstrating how to reproduce the feature or issue
 - Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug
3. Fork the repository on GitHub

## Forking

You can fork our project from GitHub, develop/merge your feature or bugfix, then submit a Pull Request. Please keep in mind that:

1. Pull requests are actual commits with your modified code
2. One pull request must contain all commits related to that feature or bug fix (full changeset)
3. Each commit should [make us happy](http://bridge.net/kb/happy-commit/)
4. The pull request should be closest to the latest target branch (a pull request of a feature from version 1.0 would most likely be unusable for a feature on version 3.0, although you might be able to use git rebase to fix that

## Submitting Changes

1. **IMPORTANT:** Please read the [Contributor License Agreement](http://bridge.net/cla/)
2. **IMPORTANT:** Complete the [Contributor License Agreement Form](http://goo.gl/forms/CvDFLA3EPO)
3. Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository
4. Submit a pull request to the related Bridge.NET project
5. Update your forum thread with a link to your Pull Request

Your Pull Request will be reviewed by the Object.NET team. We will analyze your change and if it fits the coding standards and feature demand, we’ll add it to the main project.

## Your feature is Awesomesauce!

Why don't you add it now?

Some features or fixes might be brilliant additions, but break backwards compatibility. We may consider a change ineligible for immediate merging if it turns Bridge.NET too far away from our current release plan.

Not to worry, we will try our best to add your contribution into our next release!

## Bug or Feature?

If we still have a bug lurking around we will do our best to fix it promptly.

Bug fixes are much more likely to be accepted in a short term than entirely new features that might compromise other parts of Bridge.NET or developer experience.

## Will I get paid for bugs or features?

You get paid in karma and that warm fuzzy feeling knowing you’ve helped the Bridge.NET community.

If you turn out to be a **bug squashing** and **feature adding** wizard, we would like to get to know you better. There’s always an open seat at Object.NET for a talented engineer. Please check out our [Jobs](http://bridge.net/jobs/) section for more information about working with Object.NET.

We are a fully distributed company with [team members](http://object.net/#team) spread across the earth. All positions are Remote.
